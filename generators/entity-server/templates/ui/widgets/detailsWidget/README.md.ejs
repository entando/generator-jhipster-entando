# Details Widget

## Running locally

Widgets use Keycloak for authentication. To use widget locally follow these steps (where prompted for port, use defaults):
1. Downlaod and install Keycloak standalone server (this widget has been tested with Keycloak 7.0.1) from https://www.keycloak.org/downloads.html
1. Setup Keycloak by visiting http://localhost:9080/auth/ (administrator login `admin/admin`)
    1. Create realm named `jhipster`
    1. Add client with
        * name - `jhipster-entando-react-client`
        * client protocol - `openid-connect`
        * root URL - `http://localhost:3000/`
        * valid redirect URIs - `http://localhost:3000/*`
    1. Add user with all roles assigned
1. Go to <KEYCLOAK_SERVER_FOLDER>/bin and run `./standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000` - this will offset the Keycloak port to 9080 (which is a default port JHipster uses)
1. Create microservice application, add entity (this should create the widgets) and start the application.
1. If needed (should be automated in future releases), update SecurityConfiguration.java file (<MICROSERVICE_FOLDER>/src/main/java/<PACKAGE_NAME_FOLDERS>/config/SecurityConfiguration.java) to allow OPTIONS requests by adding:
    1. `import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;` at the top
    1. `.antMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS,"/api/**").permitAll()` after `.antMatchers("/api/auth-info").permitAll()`
1. If needed (should be automated in future releases), uncomment CORS configurations at `<MICROSERVICE_FOLDER>/src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml` and/or `<MICROSERVICE_FOLDER>/src/main/resources/config/application.yml`
1. Authenticate at http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/account/ using the user you have created.
1. Go to widget source (<MICROSERVICE_FOLDER>/ui/widgets/<%= entityInstance %>/detailsWidget/>):
    1. Run `npm i`
    1. Add `.env` file with `REACT_APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:<MICROSERICE_PORT=8081>/services/<MICROSERVICE_APPLICATION_NAME>/api`
    1. Run `npm start`

## API

### Attributes

- **locale** (default: `en`)
- **id**

### Environment variables

There are several environment variables used in the widget that provide initial configuration of the widget. To set that up, create `.env` file in the root folder following constants:

- REACT_APP_DOMAIN - API endpoint for data (e.g., http://localhost:8081/services/jhipster/api)

### Events

- **<%= entityInstance %>.form.createError** (fired when an error occurs during <%= entityInstance %> creation)
- **<%= entityInstance %>.form.create** (fired when the <%= entityInstance %> is successfully created)
- **<%= entityInstance %>.form.updateError** (fired when an error occurs during <%= entityInstance %> update)
- **<%= entityInstance %>.form.update** (fired when the <%= entityInstance %> is successfully updated)

## i18n

To add a new locale:

- add _[newLocaleName]_ under `options.lng` in `i18next-scanner-config.js` script
- run `npm run i18n` from the terminal to add a new locale with empty translations file under `src/i18n/locales/[newLocaleName].json`
- edit `src/i18n/locales.js`
  - import the newly generated JSON file (use the en locale import as a reference)
  - export it alongside the other locales

Further translations can be required depending on the generated entity field types (e.g. if the entity has dates, we will need to add the `date-fns` locale used by the [Material UI Date Picker component](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/) and, potentially, we can [override `DateFnsUtils`'s methods](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/date-io/blob/master/packages/date-fns/src/date-fns-utils.ts) to customize date/time strings displayed in the date picker).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Runs Eslint to the root folder and fix all the issues that can be handled automatically.

### `npm run i18n`

Maintain language files: if there's a new locale, a new language files will be added (see **i18n** section above); if there are new untraslated strings, they will be added to language files.

## Linter

This project is extending the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) eslint rules, and applying custom rules (see package.json) to improve code quality.

## Folder structure

- ./src
  - ./assets `--> place to store assets like images, fonts, custom icons, etc.`
  - ./api `--> api calls, grouped by feature: the structure should mimic the api call itself`
  - ./components
    - ./\_\_tests\_\_ `sample test folder`
      - App.test.js `--> this way test files are closer to other ones, but in a separate folder in order to keep the folder structure cleaner`
    - ./common `--> folder containing common components`
      - CommonComponent.js
    - ./App `--> example of component that could have container`
      - App.css
      - App.js `--> keep the same name as component folder so we can find it easily when doing a file search`
      - AppContainer.js `--> container for the App component, adds state`
- ./custom-elements `--> custom element wrapper of the whole application`
  - ./state `--> application state (e.g. redux), if any`
    - ./sample-feature `--> grouping by feature`
      - sample-feature.actions.js
      - sample-feature.reducer.js
      - sample-feature.selectors.js
      - sample-feature.types.js
    - store.js `--> configure redux store`
  - index.js `--> entry point`
